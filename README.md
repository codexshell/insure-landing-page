## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A CSS framework
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A Next Generation Frontend Tooling

### What I learned

- Adding classes conditionally in `react`. There are various ways to do this, but my preferred was the method below. As you can see it uses the logical operator. This is much cleaner and concise

```js
const className = ["class1", "class2", condition && "class3"];
```

### Continued development

- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/)

### Useful resources
